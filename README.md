The purpose of this website to showcase the types of services and that my own fictional company provides, informing potential clients about the company’s services, such as web development, AI solutions, and mobile app development. The webiste is visually appealing and professional to attract customers, and there is a contact form for potential clients to contact the company.

I included 3 pages, home, services and contact
Home page includes the track record to make company credible, and also client reviews. There is also exclusive offers for first time costomers and place to input promo code. I seperaetd all into different sections for readability.

Services page outline the services offered by the company, while contact page provides contact informationa and a clickable form that allows user input.

Design reasoning: I chose this simple design to make sure that the focus is on my company and its services, and also used consistent typography and colors to make a brand identity. Blue and white is seen as professional so I only used the two colors. I used my black and white logo from applied design module to fit the color scheme.
I added alot of spacing between the elements to spread the informtation out, and also centered the main points to capture user's attention.
